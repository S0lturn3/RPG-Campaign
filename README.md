In this project i will be developing a website for my mini Tabletop RPG Campaign that i will be the DM for my friends, so i will be training my DM skills plus my Development skills!





- The first archive will be the Main Page for my website. Talking about the general idea of the campaign and it's most important features and inspirations.
- For now, i'll be using the classic "Lorem ipsum" text for a placeholder, just so i can make a functional base for the website, when i believe the base is strong,
 i will be switching it with the true informations.
